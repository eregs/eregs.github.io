    Following the 2008-era financial collapse, the US Congress created the
    Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and charged the agency with central
    authority over a swath of previously disparate regulations. Recognizing
    the opaque nature of these regulations and having the desire to iterate on
    them rapidly, the bureau's regulatory team began contemplating tools to
    aid their work.

    In a similar time-frame, the bureau was also sketching out a technology
    and innovation fellowship, in which graphic designers, software
    developers, and user experience professionals would be brought in to the
    bureau for a two-year stint. Technology projects to address regulatory
    needs quickly rose towards the top of this list. To prepare, the
    regulatory team met with the bureau's technologists and mapped out phases
    around displaying regulations, connecting them to relevant documents,
    following their history, allowing the public to comment, and tools to
    improve the authoring experience.
