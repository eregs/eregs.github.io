general_repos:
  - name: regulations-parser
    url: https://github.com/eregs/regulations-parser
    short: Parse regulations
    long: >
      The parser effectively converts print-centric documents from the Federal
      Register, Government Printing Office, etc., pulls out semantic meaning
      from them (e.g. paragraph structures, citations, definitions), and
      writes those structures to a data store. The parser also contains tools
      to help developers debug this process.
  - name: regulations-core
    url: https://github.com/eregs/regulations-core
    short: Regulations API
    long: The store for the parsed regulatory data.
  - name: regulations-site
    url: https://github.com/eregs/regulations-site
    short: Display the regulations
    long: >
      An intuitive, responsive UI for viewing the regulations. It combines all
      of the parsed data into an interface, providing in-line access to
      definitions, citations, external material and more. This is the primary
      use case for the regulatory data.
  - name: fr-notices
    url: https://github.com/eregs/fr-notices
    short: Edited source XML
    long: >
      Often, source files will need to be massaged and modified to fit the
      parser's limited understanding. This repository is a canonical source
      for these edits, across all agencies, so that developers remain in sync.
  - name: eregs.github.io
    url: https://github.com/eregs/eregs.github.io
    short: Documentation
    long: The content for these HTML pages.

      url: https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-schema
      short: Regulation XML schema
      long: >
        An experimental XML schema for defining regulations. Regulations in this
        format could then be maintained by only editing a single XML file,
        rather than worrying about external sources of data. Currently,
        CFPB-centric.
    - name: regulations-xml-parser
      url: https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-xml-parser
      short: Schema -> JSON for regulations
      long: >
        A companion to regulations-schema which takes XML following that
        schema and converts it into the format accepted by regulations-core.
    - name: regulations-stub
      url: https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-stub
      short: Parsed CFPB regulations
